# Safety in Systems Programming

## Module Summary

This class is focused on **safety** and **robustness** in systems programming: Where do things often go wrong in computer systems? How can we avoid common pitfalls? We will use the Rust programming language as a vehicle to deliver mental models and paradigms that have been shown to be helpful in preventing errors, and we will look at how these features have made their way back into C++. The first 7 lectures will focus on preventing many of the types of problems that you encountered in CS107: how can we prevent **buffer overflows**, **memory leaks**, **use-after-free** bugs, and other sorts of memory errors? Then, we will focus on preventing common mistakes that arise in the programming settings CS110 covers: how do we write safe code when **multiprocessing** and **multithreading** are involved?
